                    Hi, Iâ€™m Michael Corry, a software developer based in Nairobi, Kenya. Nice to meet you.
                    <br /><br />
                    I specialize in both frontend and backend development, including web design, APIs, and backend systems with database integration. Currently I am a freelance developer working with clients to deliver functional, well-crafted digital products.
                    <br /><br />
                    I have a keen in growing my craft and I follow that fueled with my curiosity to wherever it leads me. For more on this you can check out my gihub account.
                    <br /><br />
                    Off the screen, I enjoy exploring philosophy, spirituality, and occasionally reading fiction. Every project I undertake is an opportunity to learn and grow.

                </p>
